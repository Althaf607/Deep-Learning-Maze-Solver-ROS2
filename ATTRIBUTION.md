# Project Attribution & Fork Status

This repository is a **Personal Case Study** focused on the **Deep Learning (TD3) Implementation** of the original robotics project.

**Relation to Group Project:**
*   **Base Infrastructure:** The simulation world and basic motion planners were developed collaboratively by the Robotics Team.
*   **This Repository:** Specifically isolates and documents the **AI Agent (Actor-Critic Network)** and the **Teacher-Student Training Pipeline** developed by **Althaf Ahamed**.
*   **Differentiation:** This repository includes the detailed IEEE Report, experimental training logs, and specific optimizations for the Goal-Vector state representation that were researched individually.

*This disclosure is intended to clarify contributions for academic integrity.*
